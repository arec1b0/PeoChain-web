1. How do I become a PeoChain validator?

    Anyone meeting technical requirements (x64 CPU, 16GB+ RAM, reliable internet, SSD) can participate. There is no centralized approval or gatekeeping.

    Install the PeoChain node software, generate validator keys, and bond the required 500 PEO (testnet uses test-PEO; mainnet after launch). The bond is locked with a 14-day unbonding timelock.

    Register via CLI or web interface. Subnet assignments are deterministic, with no admin interference.

    Start your node, join the assigned subnet, and your validator will automatically participate in consensus and network governance

    .

2. What makes the PeoChain validator system non-custodial and permissionless?

    No PeoChain team member or admin can approve, reject, or censor validator entries. Slashing, onboarding, and subnet assignment are all determined algorithmically and enforced cryptographically.

    Slashing actions require proof from ≥2/3 of your subnet peers, making unilateral admin action impossible

    .

3. What are the key security best practices for validators?

    Physical/Cloud Security: Use secure, dedicated hardware or a reputable cloud VPS. Harden your OS, use firewalls, disable password SSH, and regularly update all software.

    Key Management: Keep validator keys offline when possible; use encrypted storage. Never share private keys or run the same key in multiple places.

    Redundancy: Maintain regular backups of configuration and keys. Monitor uptime—downtime impacts rewards and may result in penalties.

    Slashing Protection: Never double-sign blocks or run more than one validator instance per key. Always monitor for network or sync issues.

4. What slashing conditions exist and how do I avoid them?

    Double-signing (signing conflicting blocks/epochs), extended downtime, or malicious activity/collusion may result in slashing.

    All slashing is executed by cryptographic proof (≥2/3 subnet) and logged transparently. No admin or arbitrary slashing.

    Stay online, maintain one active instance per validator key, and watch logs for warnings.

5. How do I troubleshoot if my node is stuck syncing or fails to join a subnet?

    Confirm you’re running the latest node release.

    Check system clock (NTP); desync leads to consensus failures.

    Ensure correct bond and key configuration.

    Verify network/firewall/NAT rules allow peer discovery.

    Review logs for explicit errors (e.g., peer connectivity, assignment).

    If your subnet is at capacity, your node will queue; wait for assignment.

6. What if I get slashed or penalized unfairly?

    All penalties include publicly-auditable cryptographic proof. Disputes can be filed through the dashboard—resolution is handled by on-chain consensus, not admin.

7. How do migration and mainnet onboarding work?

    After the ICO, testnet validators can migrate to mainnet by:

        Acquiring PEO and rebonding (Conversion Path).

        “Grandfathering” if ranked as a top-performing testnet validator, with adjusted bond curves.

    All instructions will be posted well in advance in official channels. Missing deadlines or improper migration = loss of mainnet slot

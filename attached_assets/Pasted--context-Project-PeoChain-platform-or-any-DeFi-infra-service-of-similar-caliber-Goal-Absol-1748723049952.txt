  Project: PeoChain platform (or any DeFi/infra service of similar caliber).
  Goal: Absolute unification of UI patterns, full responsiveness, and DevOps discipline with zero tolerance for chaos.

<design_tokens>
{
  "color": "All colors and states (primary, secondary, accent, semantic, backgrounds) are centralized in tokens.json or via Tailwind theme.extend.",
  "spacing": "Scale from 2 to 64 px, stepwise (power-of-two), always through tokens.",
  "radius": "Standardized values only: 4, 8, 16 px (or rem), only via tokens.",
  "integration": "Tokens live in codebase and auto-sync with Figma or your chosen design tool."
}
</design_tokens>

<instructions>
  1. All new UI and patches must use only global tokens (color, spacing, radius)—absolutely no inline styles.
  2. Mobile QA is required for every key flow, especially validator onboarding and FAQ—use real devices, not just emulators.
  3. Implement a global loading skeleton and error boundary at the App level, not just in individual components.
  4. Standardize all error/success feedback: every form uses a single, unified pattern, no ad-hoc messages.
  5. Set up Storybook (or equivalent) and cover all atomic UI components and key pages with basic E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright).
  6. Automate accessibility audits (axe-core, Lighthouse) and specifically address all Radix UI edge-cases (focus, aria, escape handling).
  7. Document developer onboarding/setup; add a “component map” (UI structure map) in the README.
  8. Production must include favicon and web manifest (PWA-ready).
  9. Branded micro-interactions (button hover, nav transitions, click) must be present—brief, never distracting or excessive.
  10. Tokens must be integrated with Figma (or your design tool): bi-directional parity, no visual/code drift.
</instructions>

<validation>
  1. Confirm that all components use only tokens—no inline overrides or legacy styles.
  2. Verify mobile responsiveness across all critical user journeys.
  3. Accessibility: at least WCAG AA, with all Radix edge-cases handled.
  4. Storybook and E2E coverage: at least 80% of atomic components, key flows tested.
  5. Onboarding docs and component map are up-to-date after every major change.
  6. All forms deliver standardized feedback, with no hidden or inconsistent errors.
